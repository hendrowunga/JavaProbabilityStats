## Description

This repository contains a collection of simple Java programs designed for basic probability and statistics calculations, focusing on discrete random variables. The programs included are:

1.  **Expected Value and Variance Calculator:** Calculates E[X] (Expected Value or Mean) and Var(X) (Variance) based on a given discrete probability distribution table (X values and their corresponding P(X) probabilities).
2.  **Binomial Distribution Calculator:** Generates the probability distribution table for a Binomial Random Variable, representing the number of 'successes' (e.g., heads in coin flips) in a fixed number (K) of independent trials.

This project is suitable for learning basic probability/statistics concepts or as a quick computational tool.

## Features

*   **Expected Value & Variance Calculator (`CalculatorRandomVariable.java`):**
    *   Calculates the Expected Value (Mean/μ) of a discrete distribution.
    *   Calculates the Variance (σ²) of a discrete distribution.
    *   Displays the step-by-step calculations in a clear table format.
    *   Input data (X values and P(X) probabilities) are currently hardcoded within the program based on a sample problem.
*   **Binomial Distribution Calculator (`DistribusiBinomialKoin.java`):**
    *   Calculates the probability P(X=x) for each possible number of successes (x) from 0 to K.
    *   Utilizes the Binomial Coefficient C(n, k) formula and the Binomial probability formula.
    *   Accepts the number of trials (K) as user input.
    *   Displays the complete probability distribution table.
    *   Assumes a success probability (p) of 0.5 (fair coin) by default, but this can be modified in the code.

## Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or later.
    *   You can check your Java version by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing:
        ```bash
        java -version
        javac -version
        ```

## How to Use

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hendrowunga/JavaProbabilityStats.git
    cd JavaProbabilityStats
    ```
    Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract it.

2.  **Compile and Run the Programs:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the `.java` files.

### 1. Expected Value & Variance Calculator (`CalculatorRandomVariable.java`)

*   **Compile:**
    ```bash
    javac CalculatorRandomVariable.java
    ```
*   **Run:**
    ```bash
    java KalkulatorStatistik
    ```
*   **Output:** The program will directly print the calculation tables and the final results for Expected Value and Variance based on the hardcoded data.

### 2. Binomial Distribution Calculator (`DistribusiBinomialKoin.java`)

*   **Compile:**
    ```bash
    javac DistribusiBinomialKoin.java
    ```
*   **Run:**
    ```bash
    java DistribusiBinomialKoin
    ```
*   **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter the number of coin flips (K). Enter a non-negative integer.
*   **Output:** The program will print the Binomial probability distribution table for the entered value of K.

## Code Structure

*   **`CalculatorRandomVariable.java`**: Contains the logic for calculating Expected Value and Variance. Input data (X and P(X)) are currently set directly within the code.
*   **`DistribusiBinomialKoin.java`**: Contains the logic for calculating the Binomial Distribution. It includes helper functions for:
    *   `faktorial()`: Calculates factorials (though not used in the more robust binomial coefficient method).
    *   `koefisienBinomial()`: Calculates the combination C(n, k) efficiently.
    *   `probabilitasBinomial()`: Calculates the Binomial probability P(X=x).

## Example Output

Detailed examples of the output generated by both programs, including the step-by-step calculations and formatting as shown in the original problem description, are available in the PDF document included in this repository:
